# Insect Game

This is an Android game built with Kotlin. It was a project assigned in my mobile devices class. The main task for the project was to build a custom widget for graphics and animations by creating a class that inherits from the View class. The event handler class creates threads to animate the launching of a cannonball across the display. The path of the cannonball is calculated using projectile motion equations. 

The objective of the game is to eliminate a grid of insects in the sky by striking them with the cannonball launched from the ground. The user chooses a launch angle and an initial velocity and fires the cannonball toward the insects.
